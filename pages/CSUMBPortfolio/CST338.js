For students that wish to build applications from the ground up, this course was crucial in providing the necessary framework/structure. For those that donâ€™t, understanding the development process will still be beneficial. As Java is a cross platform, language as well as the language of choice for mobile development, the language is especially important to learn.",

											I wanted to make something that is a really good connection of a lot of the introductory parts of a language. So I made a very simplified version of Pokemon. This requires the user to select two Pokemon, then 4 moves for each Pokemon. This shows how file input and output works as well as classes and inheritance. It requires at least 3 classes with the base Pokemon class that holds all of the base stats and a move class which holds all of the move stats and name. Finally a UserPokemon class that inherits from Pokemon and adds a vector of 4 moves and adds a current health (which could be expanded to hold current stats).

											We were tasked with making a simple slot game as a way of randomizing strings based on simple percentages. The video included shows much of the approach taken. One of the challenging spots I ran into while working on this assignment was the strange stats compared to what should be expected from a slot game. For example, giving the user way too many chances of winning.

											This project was a  card game based off of a previous assignment using Java's Swing library. The game is meant to allow the user to select a card and then a pile of cards. It would then verify if the card is playable (the card is one number value above or below the card last played on that pile), then the AI will run it's turn. If both are unable to play new hands are dealt until the deck runs out of cards.
