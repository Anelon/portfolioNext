It covers the requirements for software specification and design. In this class, students are to work in a team on a software project. The course will give students the opportunity to work on a project in a more structured environment, applying software engineering and project management principles. This will be an excellent time to identify an individualâ€™s areas of improvement that may hamper them in the professional world.",

                        This class being the last class before the capstone it was a good intro to how large projects are made. Getting used to working with development branches of github and having a production branch was really nice as it gave a way to have something that is in a functioning state always avaiable while still having a good place to push changes. We also worked a lot with code reviews though pull requests and that was very helpful to have someone else look over your code before pushing it to production.
