Quaternion algebra which would allow one to use physics to calculate the locations of the graphics when implementing the game. The gaming industry has seen incredible growth, overtaking all other media in some regions.  This course will help keep students competitive in the market. In the orientation, the courseâ€™s professor mentioned that the applications of this course go beyond gaming and have potential with AI and machine learning. AI is seeing increased use across a wide range of software applications, from predictions to photo-editing, making these skills especially useful in the current market.",

I used some random noise to give some animation to the sun texture and make the stars twinkle in the back ground. Adding clouds as an atmosphere around the earth was really cool to show how levels of detail can be added with transparency.",

						Being someone that is intereted in game development I found this class really cool to see how you make 3d environments. It was also really interesting to see how you can interact with the GPU, sense taking this class I have learned about compute shaders which is using the GPU for calculations.
