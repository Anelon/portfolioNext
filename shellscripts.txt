CST336 deploy.sh
This is a script that works with my file structure to take the name of the
current folder and then makes a new branch with the current folder name. That
branch can then be watched by heroku so that it will automatically be deployed
from the git repository branch.

CST338 submit.sh
I wrote this as an automation step for preparing assignements to be submitted.
The script uses the a name of submitter and then uses the name of the folder
to name the submission file, it then formats the code according with the
class's style guide. Then it fills that file with all of the code
files in the directory, with header comments to say when each file starts and
end. After that is sets up a comment at the end to fill a run, if there is any
files with the prefix input in the directory it does one run of the code for
each of the inputs.
